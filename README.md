 ESP32 Web Server
This Arduino sketch configures the ESP32 as a standalone Wi-Fi access point and hosts a basic web server that can be accessed without any external router or internet connection. When powered on, the ESP32 creates a Wi-Fi hotspot named "ESP32_Hotspot" with the password "12345678". Devices like smartphones or laptops can connect to this network directly.

Once connected, users can open a browser and navigate to http://192.168.4.1 (the default IP address of the ESP32 AP).
